# 🚀 Overview

**SINGHAM** is an AI-powered cybersecurity platform designed to help everyday internet users detect and understand digital threats before they become victims.

Instead of relying on multiple disconnected security tools, SINGHAM brings email analysis, malicious URL detection, fake QR code verification, malware detection, and AI-powered explanations into a single intelligent platform.

The goal is to make cybersecurity simple, understandable, and accessible for everyone.

---

# ❗ Problem Statement

Modern cyber attacks have become increasingly sophisticated. Every day, users receive phishing emails, click malicious links, scan fake QR codes, and unknowingly download malware.

Most existing security tools focus on only one threat category, forcing users to switch between multiple services while still lacking a complete understanding of why something is dangerous. For non-technical users, distinguishing legitimate content from malicious content has become extremely difficult.

SINGHAM addresses this challenge by providing one unified platform capable of analyzing multiple cyber threats while explaining every prediction in simple language.

---

# 💡 Solution

SINGHAM combines Machine Learning and Large Language Models to analyze different cybersecurity threats through a single web interface.

Instead of simply labeling something as "Safe" or "Dangerous", the platform also explains **why** the prediction was made using Explainable AI (XAI). Users receive actionable recommendations that help them make safer online decisions while gradually improving their cybersecurity awareness.

# ⚙️ Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run SINGHAM on your local machine:

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed on your system.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository and navigate to the project root directory:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd SINGHAM
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment
Create and activate an isolated Python virtual environment:
- **On Linux/macOS:**
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **On Windows:**
  ```cmd
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Install all required packages from `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Assemble the Unified Project
Run the compilation script to compile the individual prototype modules into the unified `backend/` and `frontend/` folders:
```bash
python setup_project.py
```

### 6. Set Up Environment Variables
The Email Phishing analysis system relies on Google Gemini models. You need to configure a Google Gemini API Key:
1. Copy the `.env.example` file into the `backend/` directory as `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example backend/.env
   ```
2. Open `backend/.env` in your text editor and set `GEMINI_API_KEY` to your actual API key:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
   ```
   > [!TIP]
   > You can get a free API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### 7. Run the Application
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Launch the Flask development server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
